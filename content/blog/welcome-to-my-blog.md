# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome to my new blog! This is a sample post to demonstrate the markdown blog system. Here's what you can do with it:

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard markdown features:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists (like this one!)
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Images

You can include images using markdown syntax:

## Front Matter

Each blog post should include front matter at the top of the file with:

- `title`: The title of your post
- `date`: The publication date
- `author`: (optional) The post author
- `excerpt`: A short summary of the post

## Writing New Posts

To create a new blog post:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `content/blog` directory
2. Add the front matter section at the top
3. Write your content in markdown
4. The build system will automatically convert it to HTML

That's it! The post will appear in the blog index and have its own page with the blog template applied.
